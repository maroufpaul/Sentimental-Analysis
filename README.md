# Sentimental Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a set of techniques used in natural language processing or computational linguistics to extract subjective information from text. 
This information is typically extracted in the form of determining whether a text is expressing a positive, neutral, or negative opinion about something.
I created a straightforward sentiment analysis algorithm for this project in an effort to ascertain the type of opinion being conveyed in a group of movie reviews.


## Description
This project performs sentiment analysis on textual data. It utilizes a binary search tree (BST) to map and assess the sentiment of various text inputs.

## Installation
To run this project, you need a Java development environment set up. Clone the repository, compile the Java files, and ensure you have the text files in the same directory as the compiled classes.

## Usage
Execute the `SentimentAnalysis.java` file to start the analysis. You can use the provided `reviews-small.txt` or `reviews-big.txt` for sentiment analysis or provide your own text file. The `stopwords.txt` file contains a list of stopwords that are excluded from analysis.
