Sentiment analysis is a set of techniques used in natural language processing or computational linguistics to extract subjective information from text. 
This information is typically extracted in the form of determining whether a text is expressing a positive, neutral, or negative opinion about something.
I created a straightforward sentiment analysis algorithm for this project in an effort to ascertain the type of opinion being conveyed in a group of movie reviews.
